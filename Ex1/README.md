# Assignment 1 - Point3D Class

## Overview

This assignment involves the function declaration in a class named `Point3D` in the `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h` file. The class is designed to represent a point in three-dimensional space.

## Class Definition

1. **Class File:**
   - Class Definition: `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h`
   - Implementation: `/Ex1/src/Point3D.cpp`

2. **Constructor:**
   - Write a constructor for `Point3D` that takes three double variables as arguments.
   - Initializes member variables with the provided argument values.

3. **Getters:**
   - Add member functions (getters) to the class to display the member variables of the class.
   - Example: `x()` displays the x value of the `Point3D` object.

## Test Program

1. **Test Program File:**
   - Test Program: `/Ex1/src/Plane.cpp`

2. **Usage:**
   - The test program creates an object of the `Point3D` class.
   - Calls the member function to display (x, y, z) values of the created object.
   
    `mPlanePoint3D[0].x()` 
    gives (x) co-ordinate of the given Point3D.
